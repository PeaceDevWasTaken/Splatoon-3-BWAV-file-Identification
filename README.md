# Splatoon-3-BWAV-file-Identification
Gives a description of which BWAV sound file is which in Splatoon 3 aka that funny squid game. Also known as the place where you find song file names.

(I had to manually make all of this just so you know)

Basically tells you what BWAVS go where and their names

Click the .txt file corosponding to your games version! If it doesn't exist, the creator probably doesn't have that version documented.

This page is a WIP so keep that in mind!
